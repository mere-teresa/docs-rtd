eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Extensions
=========================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on May 21,

Â 

Extensions are plug-ins to eZ Publish, providing additional custom
functionality. Various extensions are available for eZ Publish. All of
them require the same basic steps for an installation. This chapter will
show how to perform the following:

#. Extract the compressed archive containing the extension
#. Activate the extension

Some extensions might require further action to make them fully
functional, e.g. creating new database tables, adding certain content
classes to eZ Publish, etc. Such additional measures are explained in
the `documentation for each extension <http://doc.ez.no/Extensions>`__.

As outlined before, this section deals with the basic steps only. For
demonstration purposes, the installation will be exemplified by an
imaginary extension called "ezfoo".
