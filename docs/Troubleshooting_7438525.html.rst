eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Troubleshooting
==============================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Oct 01,

Â 

This section explains what can be done if installation fails because of
some unknown reason.

First of all, make sure that all the
`requirements <Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation_7438584.html>`__
without exception are met, and check out the caveats from the `normal
installation
requirements <Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation_7438584.html>`__
page. The requirements are strict and extremely important, please read
them very carefully.

Checking error logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If all the requirements are met but you still have problems, it is
recommended to check any errors present in the log files.

The default error log is
``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ var/log/error.log in the
eZ Publish installation directory.

The Apache error log (usually found at ``/var/log/httpd/error_log`` on
Linux systems) is also a good source of information. It usually contains
errors from both Apache and PHP, unless the php setting ``error_log``
has been set up to log php errors to a different file.

Also check the logs generated by Symfony, which you can find under
``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/``\ ``ezpublish/logs/``. An independent log
file will be created for each environment. As an example, for the
``prod`` environment the log file will be ``prod.log``, and for ``dev``
environment it will be ``dev.log``.

Enabling debug output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For even more information, the debug output can be enabled during the
installation process.

#. Go to the
   "``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ settings/override"
   directory of your eZ Publish installation.
#. Create a new file called "``site.ini.append.php``\ " and put the
   following lines to it (without whitespace at either beginning or end
   of lines):

   ::

       [DebugSettings]
       DebugOutput=enabled

Once you have saved the file, reload the setup wizard page in the
browser. The debug output will appear at the bottom of the page.

The debug output will be displayed in both the setup wizard, the
administration interface and on the actual site. This can be disabled at
any time by replacing "enabled" with "disabled" in the same place of the
configuration file.

Note that the
"`CheckValidity <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini/SiteAccessSettings/CheckValidity>`__\ "
setting located in the "``[SiteAccessSettings]``\ " section of the same
file controls if the setup wizard should automatically start the first
time the site is accessed/browsed. If you want to restart the wizard
after its successful finishing, you can specify
"``CheckValidity=true``\ " in the
"``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ settings/override/site.ini.append.php"
file so that the setup wizard will be initiated when trying to access
the site.
