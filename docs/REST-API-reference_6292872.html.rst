eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : REST API reference
=================================================

Added by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no , edited by gaetano.giunta@ez.no on Jul
20, 2013

The complete reference of the REST API resources can be found in the
specifications: \ `https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst>`__. This
file is actually more up-to-date than this documentation, as it is used
as a development spec / reference. One problem is that it references the
whole API, which isn't actually completely implemented. Some resources
are still being worked on, but you should have most of what you need.

A more detailed description of the current implementation status will be
added to this documentation soon.

Documentation structure
-----------------------

Resources are grouped by chapters:
`Content <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#13%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0content>`__,
`Content
Types <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#14%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0content-types>`__
and \ `User <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/blob/master/doc/specifications/rest/REST-API-V2.rst#15%C2%A0%C2%A0%C2%A0user-management>`__.
In each of those chapters, you will first get an overview, with a table
crossing every resource with every applicable HTTP verb, and giving you
a summary of the action.

Then throughout the chapter, grouped into sub-chapters, detailed
documentation for every resource, with:

-  The resource string
-  The HTTP verb with override, if applicable
-  A description of what this resource does
-  Which headers are supported, and how to use them
-  Which error codes can occur
-  Most of the time, a request + response example
