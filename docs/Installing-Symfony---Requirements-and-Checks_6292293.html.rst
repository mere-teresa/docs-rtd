Please find below the mandatory requirements and the checks that are
performed when you install Symfony, and adapt your environment
accordingly, so you can successfully install and use it with in your eZ
Publish 5 projects.

Icon

Pre-requisite: You must have downloaded Symfony to your computer.

After downloading Symfony, run the following script:

.. code:: theme:

    php app/check/check.php

This script will take you to the basic configurations of your project.
You can also do the same by editing the '*app/config/parameters.ini*\ '
file.\ **
**

**Mandatory Requirements:**

-  PHP version must be at least 5.3.2 or higher
-  The "date.timezone" setting must be set
-  The app/logs directory must be writable
-  The app/cache directory must be writable
-  The json\_encode() must be available

**Optional Checks:**

-  The PHP-XML module is installed
-  The libxml version is at least 2.6.21
-  The token\_get\_all() function is available
-  The mb\_strlen() function is available
-  The iconv() function is available
-  The utf8\_decode() is available
-  The posix\_isatty() is available
-  The intl extension is available
-  The PHP accelerator is installed
-  The php.ini file has short\_open\_tag set to off
-  The php.ini file has magic\_quotes\_gpc set to off
-  The php.ini file has register\_globals set to off
-  The php.ini file has session.auto\_start set to off

**Optional Checks (Doctrine):**

-  PDO is installed
-  PDO has some drivers installed: mysql, odbc, sqlite2, sqlite

   Icon

   Note that the PHP CLI can use a different php.ini file than the one
   used with your web server. In this case please, also lunch this
   utility from your web server.

   When you run the 'php.check' script, it will show you the path of the
   php.ini file used by PHP, for instance: "*php used by PHP:
   /opt/local/etc/php5/php.ini*\ ".

 

The script will check all points listed above. Take the actions needed
to correct any problem that occurs, and then click on the "**Re-check
Configuration**\ " link to start the checking again.

Ahh that's nice \ |(smile)| but i have a question.. why not keeping
check.php from Symfony2 stack ? could be easier to maintain no ?

Is there a page on symfony.com that explains this? If so then
we shouldn't duplicate it as this kind of info has a tendency to change
more often then you like to keep track of.

On Symfony.com there is only this
page: \ `http://symfony.com/doc/2.1/reference/requirements.html <http://symfony.com/doc/2.1/reference/requirements.html>`__
