eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Developing with eZ Publish 5
===========================================================

Added by andre.romcke@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Jul 02,

Documentation on how to develop sites and applications using eZ Publish
5.

This covers common, everyday tasks - basic to intermediate level.For
more advanced development techniques, and extending the provided
functionality, see `Extending eZ Publish
5 <Extending-eZ-Publish-5_1736733.html>`__

 

| There are two official approaches to building applications on top of
eZ Publish 5: by connecting to the `eZ Publish REST
API <eZ-Publish-REST-API_6292277.html>`__ OR by using the `eZ Publish
Public
API <eZ-Publish-Public-API_1736723.html>`__ and `MVC/Application <MVC-and-Application_2719826.html>`__ layer
(Symfony2 based).
| In the latter case Public SPI provides the "model" (the data from the
database and the file system) and the MVC/Application layer provides all
the application logic (configuration, routing, controlling, etc...).
