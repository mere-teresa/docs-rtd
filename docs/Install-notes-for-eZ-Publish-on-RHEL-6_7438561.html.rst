RHEL 6 and CentOS 6: EPEL
-------------------------

| Some of the listed rpms are only available through EPEL. Extra
Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) is a Fedora Special Interest Group
that creates, maintains, and manages a high quality set of additional
packages for Enterprise Linux, including, but not limited to, Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS and Scientific Linux (SL).
| `http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How\_can\_I\_use\_these\_extra\_packages.3F <http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F>`__

::

    $ rpm -Uvh http://fedora.uib.no/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm

Best practice will be to disable EPEL by default and only enable it for
specific rpm installs with the yum option "``--enablerepo=epel``\ ". To
disable it, set "``enabled=0``\ " in "``/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo``\ ".

Red Hat Network
---------------

RHEL 6.1: The Certificate-based RHN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| If upgrading from RHEL 6 to RHEL 6.1, you would like to use the new
subscription system:
| For a first-time certificate-based RHN registration:

#. Run the command

   ::

       subscription-manager register

#. Log into
   `https://access.redhat.com/management/consumers/ <https://access.redhat.com/management/consumers/>`__

   #. Click on the registered system in the consumer list
   #. Find the list of available subscriptions
   #. Subscribe to the relevant subscriptions

#. Run the command

   ::

       subscription-manager subscribe --auto

#. Run the command

   ::

       yum update

   and all subscribed repos will be configured

    

With the certificate-based RHN, additional channels are not added
through manual configuration. Additional rpm repositories are listed in
``/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo``, but are disabled by default. Yum
install using the ``--enablerepo`` option and notice that the
repositories may look different based on the installed product.

::

    $ yum --enablerepo=rhel-6-server-optional-rpms install php-process

 

RHEL 6.0: The classic RHN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Log into Red Hat Network
-  Click on "Channels" in the menu bar.
-  Click "Red Hat Optional Server 6", "target systems" and enable this
   channel for your server
