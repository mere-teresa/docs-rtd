eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Extracting the files
===================================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Sep 25,

Each extension is distributed as a compressed archive. The name of the
archive file includes the name of the extension and its release version.
Furthermore, the compression type is indicated by the file ending,
either "tgz", "tar.gz", "bz2", or "zip". For example:

-  ezfoo-extension-1.0.tgz
-  ezfoo-extension-1.0.tar.gz
-  ezfoo-extension-1.0.bz2
-  ezfoo-extension-1.0.zip

Windows users should download the "zip" archive. Linux/UNIX users may
download any archive format as long as the necessary unpacking tools are
available.

Extension base directory
------------------------

Copy the downloaded archive into the "extension" directory of your eZ
Publish installation. If this directory does not exist yet, then create
it. (Do not create the directory with the plural naming "extensions" -
this is a common error.)

The following shell commands can be used to create the "extension"
directory and copy the archive on a Linux/UNIX system:

::

    mkdir <eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/extension/
    cp /home/myuser/download/ezfoo-extension-1.0.tar.gz <eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/extension/

 

Replace "<eZ\_Publish\_root\_folder>" with the actual path to your eZ
Publish installation and
"/home/myuser/download/ezfoo-extension-1.0.tar.gz" with the actual path
to the downloaded archive.

Unpack the archive
------------------

The archive should be unpacked inside the "extension" directory. When
done correctly, an "ezfoo" directory will be created inside the
"extension" directory.

See the following table for the correct shell command to use on a
Linux/UNIX system, depending on the compression type:

**Archive type**

**Command to extract**

tar.gz or tgz

.. code:: wordwrap

    tar -zxvf ezfoo-extension-1.0.tar.gz

or

.. code:: wordwrap

    tar -zxvf ezfoo-extension-1.0.tgz

bz2

.. code:: wordwrap

    tar -jxvf ezfoo-extension-1.0.bz2

zip

.. code:: wordwrap

    unzip ezfoo-extension-1.0.zip

On Windows, you can just unzip the "zip" file using the built-in zip
features.

At this point, the unpacked files should be available under
"extension/ezfoo".
