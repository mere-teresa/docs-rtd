eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Activating the extension
=======================================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Sep 25,
2013

 

Each extension needs to be activated, which means that it is being
registered for eZ Publish to be available from within the eZ Publish
framework. Every extension can either be activated in the eZ Publish
administration interface or in a configuration file. Furthermore, the
activation can be done either for the whole eZ Publish installation or
for only certain site accesses.

**Note:** As of the 4.4 release of eZ Publish we have implemented a
feature for automatic loading of extensions in the required sequence.
Please go to `Extension load
ordering <Extension-load-ordering_7438655.html>`__ for more information
on how to do this. If you are running on releases prior to 4.4, please
continue reading below.

Administration interface
------------------------

Log in to your eZ Publish administration interface, click on the "Setup"
tab, and then click "Extensions" on the left. You will see the list of
available extensions with check-boxes. Simply select the ones you need
as shown in the screenshot below and click the "Apply changes" button.

Extension Activation

This will activate the extension for all siteaccesses of your eZ Publish
installation.

Configuration file
------------------

Alternatively, an extension can be enabled manually in the
`site.ini <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/Configuration-files/site.ini>`__
configuration file.

Activating for the whole installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the sample extension for all of your site accesses, edit the
"``site.ini.append.php``\ " file located in the
"``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ ``settings/override``"
directory of your eZ Publish installation. Add the following line under
the "``[ExtensionSettings]``\ " `configuration
block <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/5.x/Concepts-and-basics/Configuration>`__:

::

    ActiveExtensions[]=ezfoo

 

Multiple extensions can be present within the
"``[ExtensionSettings]``\ " block. You'll have to manually create the
file and/or the section if they do not exist.

Activating for certain siteaccesses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable the sample extension for only a single site access called
"example", edit the "``site.ini.append.php``\ " file located in the
"``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ settings/siteaccess/example"
directory of your eZ Publish installation. Add the following line under
the "``[ExtensionSettings]``\ " configuration block:

::

    ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezfoo

 

Note that the line registering the extension is not called
"``ActiveExtensions``\ ", but "``ActiveAccessExtensions``\ ". You'll
have to manually create the file and/or the section if they do not
exist.

Updating the autoload arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After updating the configuration file(s), you need to run the
"``ezpgenerateautoloads.php``\ " script, in order to add the information
about all PHP class definitions of this extension to the
"``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ ``autoload/ezp_extension.php``"
file, otherwise eZ Publish might not be able to execute the PHP code of
the newly added extension. The following example shows how to run the
script.

#. Navigate into the ``ezpublish_legacy/`` directory.
#. Run the script using the following shell command:

   ::

       bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

The script will look for class definitions in the "extensions" directory
and update the
"``<eZ_Publish_root_folder>/ezpublish_legacy/``\ autoload/ezp\_extension.php"
file accordingly.
