This section is restricted for now as it is more how to hack on eZ
Publish as a community member and does not belong in this section, just
confusing. If issues arrises becasue REST doc here was used somewhere,
move it and refactor it to fit somewhere else please.

Sub pages in this section have information about how to implement
additional features in the Core of eZ Publish 5.

Developers should be comfortable with the concepts outlined in the
`Developing with eZ Publish
5 <Developing-with-eZ-Publish-5_2720528.html>`__ and `Extending eZ
Publish 5 <Extending-eZ-Publish-5_1736733.html>`__ sections before
continuing.

Getting acquainted with `Development
Guidelines <Development-Guidelines_6291691.html>`__ is also recommended.
