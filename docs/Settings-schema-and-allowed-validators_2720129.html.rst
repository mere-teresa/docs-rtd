eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Settings schema and allowed validators
=====================================================================

Internal FieldType conventions and best practices
=================================================

FieldType->$settingsSchema and FieldType->$allowedValidators are
intentionally left free-form, to give broadest freedom to FieldType
developers. However, for internal FieldTypes (aka those delivered with
eZ Publish), a common standard should be established as best practice.
The purpose of this page is to collect and unify this standard.

Settings schema
---------------

The general format of the settings schema of a FieldType is a hashmap of
setting names, assigned to their type and default value, e.g.:

::

    array(    'myFancySetting' => array(        'type' => 'int',        'default' => 23,    ),    'myOtherFancySetting' => array(        'type' => 'string',        'default' => 'Sindelfingen',    ),);

The type should be either a valid PHP type shortcut (TB discussed) or
one of the following special types:

-  Hash (a simple hash map)
-  Choice (an enumeration)
-  <<<YOUR TYPE HERE>>>

Validators
----------

Validators are internally handled through a special ValidatorService …
(TBD: Explain service and how it works)

The following validators are available and carry the defined settings …
(TBD: Collect validators and their settings)

Comments:
---------

About "choice": I didn't make that one up. I saw it used in several
FieldTypes, and thought it made sense.
