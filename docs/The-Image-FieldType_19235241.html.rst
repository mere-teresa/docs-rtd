eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : The Image FieldType
==================================================

Added by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no , edited by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no on

The image FieldType allows you to store an image file in a Field. Those
images will then be usable as variations, generated from the original
through a set of filters.

Image files storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FieldType uses the IO service to manipulate image files. Naming of
files depends on the Storage Engine.

Legacy Storage Engine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Default
path: <varDir>/storage/images/<FieIdId[-1]>/<FieIdId[-2]>/<FieIdId[-3]>/<FieIdId[-4]>/<FieldId>-<VersionNumber>-<LanguageCode>/
| <FieldId[-n]> represents the ID's digits, taken in reverse.
| This namping algorithm should ensure an even repartition of image
files on the filesystem, and avoid hitting the inode limit in storage
directories.

Files are named after the originally uploaded file.
