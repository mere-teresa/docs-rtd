eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : eZ Publish Public API
====================================================

Added by andre.romcke@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Aug 02,
2013

The Public API is a PHP API. Currently it exposes a Repository which
allows you to create, read, update, manage and delete all objects
available in eZ Publish, first and foremost content, but also related
objects like sections, locations, content types, content types groups,
languages and so on.

If you used eZ Publish 3.x or 4.x in the past, please check out
the \ `Intro for eZ Publish 4.x/3.x developers <2720567.html>`__, it
will give you an introduction to the domain language used in eZ Publish
5.x.

For more information on high level architecture overview, this will
be available soon. If you would like to dive into the interfaces and
structures available in the Public API, there is a SDK doc
`here <http://apidoc.ez.no/sami/trunk/NS/html/eZ/Publish/API/Repository.html>`__.
