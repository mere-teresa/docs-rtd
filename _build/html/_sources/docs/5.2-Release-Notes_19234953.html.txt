Meet the updated eZ Publish Platform 5.2
----------------------------------------

*Tag line: We highly recommend 5.2.x as a baseline for creating new
Symfony / eZ Publish Platform 5.x based web sites, as it will make your
life easier.*

|image0|

eZ Publish Platform 5.2 is a STS (Short term supported) release towards
5.3 LTS (Long term supported) which enhances several aspects of the 5.x
kernel for usability and extensibility, in addition
to additional performance improvements on top of what 5.1 delivered. The
main topic of 5.2 has been to improved a lot in terms of building
websites, DemoBundle should now serve as an good example.

5.2 is on a direct path to 5.3LTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Even if you plan to launch on 5.3 LTS, no worries, we plan to add richer
composer support in the next couple of months providing you a more
streamlined update process allowing you to start using 5.2 right now.

5.2 Features
------------

5.2 introduces several new features which makes it easier to use, faster
to develop on and also improves performance across the board.
Performance tests using jMeter\* internally have shown up to 25%
improvement (from 361 to 452) to requests per seconds when testing on
pure new stack using eZ Demo, while also improving legacy fallback
performance 18% on ezflow (from 37 to 43 requests per second).

Context-aware HTTP cache with *UserHash*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With eZ Publish Platform 5.2, new stack's HTTP cache is finally on par
and beyond what was possible in eZ Publish 4.x/legacy. With *UserHash*,
by default all internal controllers, including the ViewController, will
return cacheable responses, based on user access rules. This behavior is
also applicable to custom controllers by making their response *vary* on
``X-User-Hash`` header. Moreover, UserHash generation, initially based
on current user's assigned roles and policies, is extensible.

Purging is furthermore done in a **stale cache** like way, making sure
stale cache gets served while the new one is being generated.

   generation <How-to-customize-UserHash-generation_14712852.html>`__.
-  `Original
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/368>`__.

Symfony 2.3.\*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated our web framework foundation to Symfony 2.3 LTS, more info on
this release can be found
`here <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-3-0-the-first-lts-is-now-available>`__.

Content Controller override support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Have you ever been missing a way to extend the provided content
controller? Had needs to do custom cache logic and been missing the good
old ``cache_ttl = 0`` hack?
| 5.2 brings with it a powerful way to use the existing override system
to, instead of overriding just a template, **override the whole
controller**. This allows you to extend the built-in controller and for
instance get full access to tune the cache headers for a specific
content type that has different use than normal content, or just enrich
the final template.

-  `How to use a custom controller to display a content or
   location <How-to-use-a-custom-controller-to-display-a-content-or-location_13468497.html>`__.
-  `Original
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/426>`__.

API Signals listenable, also via Symfony event system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Signal slot events are now fully *listenable*, which makes it possible
to react on core API signals. These events are now also dispatched over
Symfony's event system so you can listen to them there synchronously,
while custom slots (listeners for signals) can in the future be
dispatched asynchronously. 

This enhancement makes it possible to define micro-workflows.

-  `How to listen to Core
   events <How-to-listen-to-Core-events_14123362.html>`__.
-  `Signals
   reference <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/Signals+reference>`__.
-  `Original
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/440>`__.

Multi repository persistence cache support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This release resolves a limitation with persistence caching introduced
in 5.1, a new caching service "ezpublish.cache\_pool" takes a siteaccess
group setting "cache\_pool" into consideration for selecting cache
service, and hence can be configured with multi repository setups in
mind. In addition you can now safely reuse this cache pool as the
persistence cache is prefixed within "spi" cache key and will not clear
your data if you reuse it.

-  `Updated documentation on reusing the cache
   service <Persistence-cache_10158280.html>`__
-  `Updated documentation on configuring multi repository
   setup <Persistence-cache-configuration_12781293.html>`__
-  `Original
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/491>`__

Support for more than 30 languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With 64-bits servers now being common, this release takes advantage of
that if present and provides support for **up to 62 languages on 64-bits
environments** and **30 languages on 32-bits platforms**. This feature
is supported across both *Symfony stack* and *legacy stack*, and is
accomplished by increasing the size of the integer field used for
language bit masks. Improved storage engines still has the possibility
to provide even more languages on pure *Symfony stack* in the future.

   `legacy <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/pull/746>`__,
   `5.x <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/493>`__

Extended support for comments with CommentsBundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Brand new CommendsBundle provides an abstracted way to display
comments. It is \ **provider based**, which means that it is open
to \ **any kind of commenting system**.

It has native support for **Disqus** and **Facebook comments**.

-  `CommentsBundle <https://github.com/ezsystems/CommentsBundle>`__
-  `Documentation <https://github.com/ezsystems/CommentsBundle/blob/master/Resources/doc/index.md>`__

Pagerfanta support for pagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Pagination can easily become cumbersome when done by hand.
**Pagerfanta** is a powerful library for object oriented pagination,
standard in the Symfony world. eZ Publish Platform 5.2 comes with native
support of PagerFanta, with dedicated adapters.

-  `How to paginate API search
   results <How-to-paginate-API-search-results_17105786.html>`__
-  `Initial
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/558>`__
-  External links

   -  `WhiteOctoberPagerfantaBundle <https://github.com/whiteoctober/WhiteOctoberPagerfantaBundle>`__

Custom tags for XMLText field type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3rd party custom tags support have been greatly improved and
implementation is now much easier. It is now possible add a custom XSL
stylesheet to the main one and to assign a priority. This also makes it
possible to easily override existing eZXML tags rendering.

-  `How to implement a Custom Tag for XMLText
   FieldType <How-to-implement-a-Custom-Tag-for-XMLText-FieldType_15204463.html>`__
-  `Initial
   pull-request <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-kernel/pull/456>`__

Extensible REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The eZ Publish Platform REST API can now easily be extended: custom
routes, media-types...
| Our framework will easily handle input parsing, error handling and
output generation (to XML or JSON) for you.

-  See \ `Extending the REST
   API <Extending-the-REST-API_13468575.html>`__.

DFS table split
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DFS MySQLi implementation now uses two distinct tables for storage
and cache. The main benefit is that clearing cache is as simple as
truncating the cache table without affecting storage in any way. This
feature is enabled by default, and can easily be disabled.

-  Pull
   request: \ `https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/pull/750 <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/pull/750>`__
-  `Technical
   documentation <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-legacy/blob/master/doc/features/5.2/dfs_split_tables.md>`__
-  Initial feature suggestion by \ `@omh <https://github.com/omh>`__

Javascript REST Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of this release we have made the Javascript REST client which we
aim to use in our future user interface open, this can be found on
github and can be used for your own REST needs.

-  `github.com/ezsystems/ez-js-rest-client <https://github.com/ezsystems/ez-js-rest-client>`__

Configurable front controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard symfony like index\*.php files can now be configured using
environment variables, no need to change the file anymore.

-  `Apache Virtual host setup <Virtual-host-setup_7438507.html>`__
-  For all possibilities check at any time, check
   your \ `web/index.php <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-community/blob/master/web/index.php>`__
   and
   `web/index\_dev.php <https://github.com/ezsystems/ezpublish-community/blob/master/web/index_dev.php>`__ (note:
   links goes to "master" and might include features not found in your
   version)

 

Miscellaneous helpers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Various Twig helpers were added to ease daily tasks, such as:

-  `ez\_content\_name <ez_content_name_17105551.html>`__, to display a
   Content name in the current language.
-  `ez\_field\_value <ez_field_value_17105557.html>`__, to get a Field
   value in the current language.
-  `ez\_is\_field\_empty <ez_is_field_empty_17105612.html>`__, to check
   if a given field is empty for the current language.

 

Icon

These helpers are also available in PHP code through ``FieldHelper``
(service ID: ``ezpublish.field_helper``) and ``TranslationHelper``
(service ID: ``ezpublish.translation_helper``) services.
