5.2 Release Notes
-----------------

Complete HTTP cache with "UserHash"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With eZ Publish 5.2, new stacks HTTP cache is final on par and beyond
what was possible in eZ Publish legacy. With user hash, by default all
embed controller calls using esi will be cached based on user access
rules. Purging is furthermore done in a stale cache like way, making
sure stale cache gets served while the cache is re generated. 5.2 has in
internal testing shown some noticeable performance improvements thanks
to the introduction of userHash.

Symfony 2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated our web framework foundation to Symfony 2.3 LTS, more info on
this release can be found
`here <http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-2-3-0-the-first-lts-is-now-available>`__.

Content controller overrides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Have you been missing a way to extend the provided content controller?
Had needs to do custom cache logic and been missing the good old
cache\_ttl = 0 hack?
| 5.2 brings with it a powerful way to use the existing override system
to instead of overriding just a template, override the whole controller,
this allows you to extend the built in controller and for instance get
full access to tune the cache headers for a specific content type that
has different use than normal content.

Signal slot events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
