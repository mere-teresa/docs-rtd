eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : eZ JS Core rewrite rules
=======================================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on May 21,

These rewrite rules are described in the documentation of the eZ JS Core
extension, but since this extension is bundled with eZ Publish and plays
an important part of the installation process, the eZ JS Core rewrite
rules are described here as well.

Rewrite rules for lib folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The eZ JSCore extension requires correct rewrite rules in order to
load the necessary ``yui`` (yahoo user interface) files from the file
system. This is required only when the INI setting
"``ezjscore.ini[eZJSCore]LoadFromCDN``\ " is set to ``disabled``.
| Add the following line to your Virtual-Host setup:

::

    ^/extension/[^/]+/design/[^/]+/(stylesheets|flash|images|lib|javascripts?)/.* - [L]

Rewrite rules for script/css packing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eZ JsCore packs javascript/css files together to decrease the number of
server requests and reduce file size for faster download. On eZ Publish
4.0.x you'll need to make the following changes if you haven't already
when installing ezoe (Online Editor 5.0).

-  |  .htaccess

    

   from:

   ::

       RewriteRule !\.(gif|jpe?g|png|css|js|html)|var(.+)storage.pdf(.+)\.pdf$ index.php

   | 
   | to:

   ::

       RewriteRule !(\.(gif|jpe?g|png|css|js|html?)|var(.+)storage.pdf(.+)\.pdf)$ index.php

 

-  Virtual Host mode

    

   add:

   ::

       RewriteRule ^/var/([^/]+/)?cache/public/.* - [L]

   Icon

   If you do not manage to get these working, you can disable this
   feature by setting ``ezjscore.ini[eZJSCore]Packer=disabled``.
