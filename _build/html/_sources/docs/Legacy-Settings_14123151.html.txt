eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Legacy Settings
==============================================

Added by ricardo.correia@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Jul
12, 2013

This section includes information about newly introduced legacy settings
in eZ Publish 5.

For details on the 4.x legacy settings please refer to the related
`section on
doc.ez.no <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.x/Reference/Configuration-files/>`__.

``menu.ini``
============

``[Leftmenu_<menu>]``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

``Enabled_<Links_index>[]``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Icon

This legacy setting has been introduced in eZ Publish 5.2.

| The ``Enabled_<Links_index>[]`` setting has been **introduced in
5.2**, and allows you to make links from a menu clickable on not
clickable, which links are defined in the setting arrays ``Links[]``
(for the URL) and in ``LinkNames[]`` (for the link text).
| Consider ``<Links_index>`` to be the same index defined in
``Links[<Links_index>]`` and ``LinkNames[<Links_index>]``.

This setting expects the specification of an index, which can represents
the the current
`ui\_context <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/4.7/Templates/The-pagelayout/Variables-in-pagelayout>`__,
or default, for the link to be clickable or not clickable in all
*ui\_contexts* (navigation, edit, browse, etc), or in a particular one.
The setting expects a ``true`` or ``false`` value, and the default value
is ``true``.

**Usage example**

.. code:: theme:

    Enabled_<Links_index>[browse]=false

 

 

 

Comments:
---------

This doc should have been on doc.ez.no to keep it among the other legacy
settings for consistency.

In part I agree with that, but in this case this setting has been
introduced in 5.2, and it doesn't exist in any of the previous versions.
This is why I avoided documenting this legacy setting in 4.x.
