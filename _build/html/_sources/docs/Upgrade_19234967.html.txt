eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Upgrade
======================================

Added by ricardo.correia@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Nov
12, 2013

This chapter contains information related to the upgrade of an eZ
Publish solution.

If eZ Publish is used correctly, then upgrades should be very easy. This
means that if you have not tampered with the kernel files, changed the
database, the default settings and/or templates, everything should be
okay. If you have, then you should know what you are doing.

If you haven't done so already, make sure that you have a backup and
that your data is in a consistent state
