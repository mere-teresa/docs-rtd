eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Installation
===========================================

This chapter explains how to obtain and install eZ Publish. In addition,
it also describes how to remove an existing eZ Publish installation.

If you don't want to install eZ Publish yourself, you can always hire
`eZ Systems <http://www.ez.no>`__ to install and setup the software for
you. It is also possible to purchase a hosted eZ Publish solution from
various providers and partners.

There are 3 ways of installing eZ Publish:

#. Normal installation (recommended)
#. Manual installation
#. Automated installation

Normal installation
===================

| This is\ **the recommended and most commonly used way** of installing
eZ Publish.
| It requires a system which already has the proper environment
installed, most notably a web server and a database.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. A web-based setup wizard
is initiated using a browser. The setup wizard asks a couple of
questions and automatically configures eZ Publish.

The method is explained under the \ `Normal
installation <Normal-installation_7438509.html>`__ section.

Manual installation
===================

| This option is **for experienced users**. No wizards or fancy dialogs,
no bundled software, no installers, no nothing.
| This method requires a system which already has a web-server and a
database set up and ready to go.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. The system is then
configured by manually altering various configuration files and making
manual changes to the database.

This method is explained under the `Manual
installation <Manual-installation_7438512.html>`__ section.

Automated installation
======================

| This installation method (also named kick-start) is designed **for
system administrators** who wish to roll out pre-configured
installations of eZ Publish that require a minimum of interaction with
the web-based setup wizard.
| It requires a system which already has the proper environment
installed, most notably a web server and a database.

eZ Publish needs to be downloaded and unpacked. Instead of clicking
through the setup wizard and manually providing configuration
parameters, the system is installed based on a group of settings defined
in a configuration file.

The \ `Automated installation <Automated-installation_7438514.html>`__
section explains how to prepare such a configuration file.
