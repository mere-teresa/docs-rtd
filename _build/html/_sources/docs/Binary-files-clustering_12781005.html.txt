eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Binary files clustering
======================================================

Added by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no , edited by bertrand.dunogier@ez.no on

The eZ Publish 5 API supports multiple binary file handling mechanisms
by means of an \ ``IOHandler`` interface.

The Legacy IO Handler
---------------------

The system comes with three handlers: Legacy, InMemory and Filesystem.
Only Legacy is supported in eZ Publish 5.1. It uses the Legacy Kernel,
that supports the DFS file handler, in order to provide clustering
features for scalability and safety. This handler provides multi-server
storage by means of a database + a network share.

Setup
-----

No eZ Publish 5 level steps are required at the time of 5.1. See the
legacy documentation page that explains \ `how to setup a DFS
cluster <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/5.x/Features/Clustering/Setting-it-up-for-an-eZDFSFileHandler>`__.

Configuration
-------------

YAML
~~~~

No configuration is required on the new stack. The handler will reuse
whatever configuration is defined in your eZ Publish Legacy instance. By
default, Legacy will be configured to use the FS cluster handler,
meaning files will be stored on the filesystem. No further configuration
will be required.

The Legacy documentation explains how to enable
clustering: \ `http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/5.x/Features/Clustering <http://doc.ez.no/eZ-Publish/Technical-manual/5.x/Features/Clustering>`__.

Note that the only two supported options are now FS and DFS. The DB
cluster is deprecated, and doesn't exist in eZ Publish 5.1.

Web server
~~~~~~~~~~

As for legacy, rewrite rules are required in order to serve files stored
in a DFS cluster. The \ `virtualhost setup
documentation <https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP51/Virtual+host+example>`__ provides
the required rules.
