eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Legacy siteaccess injection
==========================================================

Added by andre.romcke@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on May 21,
2013

For better integration between 5.x (symfony based) kernel and legacy
(4.x) kernel, injection is used to inject
`settings <Legacy-configuration-injection_8323268.html>`__,
`session <Legacy-session-injection_8323285.html>`__ and current
siteaccess from 5.x into legacy using an
event:Â \ `kernel.event\_subscriber <Legacy-kernel-event_8323280.html>`__

Injected siteaccess
-------------------

When eZ Publish legacy (4.x kernel and extensions) are running via the
new eZ Publish 5 kernel, then the 5.x Siteaccess is injected into it to
avoid having to match twice and maintain two set of matching rules.

To configure siteaccess in your eZ Publish 5 setup, look to the 5.x
documentation of `Siteaccess
matching <Siteaccess-Matching_2719830.html>`__.
