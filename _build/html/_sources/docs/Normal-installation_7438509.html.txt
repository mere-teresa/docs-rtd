eZ Publish Platform 5.<next> : Normal installation
==================================================

Added by andrea.melo@ez.no , edited by ricardo.correia@ez.no on Nov 22,

Â 

The normal installation method is the most common and recommended way of
deploying eZ Publish. It requires a system which already has the proper
environment installed, most notably a web server and a database. The
necessary requirements are explained in detail within the `next
section <Requirements-for-doing-a-normal-installation_7438584.html>`__.

Once the web based setup wizard has completed, eZ Publish will be ready
for use.

The "`Installing eZ Publish on a Linux-UNIX based
system <Installing-eZ-Publish-on-a-Linux-UNIX-based-system_7438581.html>`__\ "
and "`Installing eZ Publish on
Windows <Installing-eZ-Publish-on-Windows_7438583.html>`__\ " sections
(depending on the target OS) will take you through the necessary steps.

Comments:
---------

Should be better to add something about file permission and file asset
linking in the steps?

For instance "Prepare the extracted files" can be changed to "Prepare
the extracted files: file permission and link asset"?

The reason I propose this is that this page is some people might just
look at steps and then go for http://<host>/ezsetup. And it result in
error which is difficult to fine reason(you need to look into apache
log).
